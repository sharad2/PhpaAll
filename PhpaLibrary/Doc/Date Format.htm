            Controlling Date Format in the PHPA Application</h1>
<p class="style1">
            SS: 7 July 2008</p>
        <p>
            By default, the application displays all dates in the d/M/yyyy format. The end 
            user has no control on this format. This format is hardwired in the 
            InitializeCulture() override in the PageBase class. All pages must derive from 
            this class. If you forget to derive from this class, you will not receive proper 
            date formatting.</p>
<p>
            This class defines the ShortDatePattern to be d/M/yyyy. This means that whenever 
            you use the string.Format(&quot;{0:d}&quot;, dateVariable) syntax, the output would be 
            similar to 21/8/2008. No other behavior of date will change.</p>
<p>
            DateTextBox class has been designed to accept dates in the d/M/yyyy format.</p>

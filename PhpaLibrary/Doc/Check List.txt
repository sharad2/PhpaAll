General
=======
Use the page as a user and make sure that you are comfortable with using the page.
- Is the page clear about what its purpose is?
- Is the information presented comprehensible?
- Are data entry forms intuitive and well validated?

Check List to be followed by developer
======================================

1.	Make sure that title of the page is given.
2.	Make sure that GUI is consistent and follows the philosphy set for the project.
3.	Every page must have a short discription at the top of the page and a detailed discription in the help contentplaceholder.
4.	Check your GUI for spelling mistakes.
5.	Provide proper link of your page in the home page.
6.	Provide sorting wherever required and Check that  default sorting is provided in the appropiate column
7.	Negative values should come in braces ()
8.	Check that alignment is proper.
9.	For PHPA project the refrance screen is Voucher screen. If you are not following the pattern of voucher make sure that you discuss it first.
10.	Id is for internal use it should not be shown in the GUI.


Guidelines for GUI development
==============================

1. Tolltips should be provided where necessary. They help in debugging also.
2. Tab order should be specified in every data-entry form.
3. Do not just dump screen with data, try to be descriptive. For example if you are developing a report 
   then you should explain the purpose and usability of it.
 
4. Heading should be in bold with clear distinction from rest of the text.

Given below are some examples of User Reactions to GUIs. You should have a clear answer for these questions. Ask these questions to
yourself before procedding for review.

"Why is the screen taking so long to run?" 
- Screen should not show huge data needlessly. Try to make your queries faster by optimising them
  and provide indexes whenever necessary.

"Which part am I supposed to be looking at?" 
- Make your screen communicate by providing helpfull text.

"Why is it showing this data?" 
- Explain how the information on screen can be used in.

5. (SS 22 Jun 2008) If no data is retrieved, a reasonable message should be shown. Ideally, the user should be told, what to do to
get some data.
